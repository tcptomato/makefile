makefile
========

Template for a non-recursive makefile build system.

Will rebuild the project when a header changes, no need to touch the corresponding code files. Just put the makefile fragment in every subfolder you need and modify it to suit your needs ( by default uses wildcards for .c, .cpp and .h).

Suggestions welcome.
